> **Abstract:** *Virtual try-on (VTON) aims at fitting target clothesto reference person images, which is widelyadopted in e-commerce.Existing VTON ap-proaches can be narrowly categorized into Parser-Based (PB) and Parser-Free (PF) by whether rely-ing on the parser information to mask the personsâ€™clothes and synthesize try-on images. Althoughabandoning parser information has improved theapplicability of PF methods, the ability of detailsynthesizing has also been sacrificed. As a re-sult, the distraction from original cloth may persistin synthesized images, especially in complicatedpostures and high resolution applications. To ad-dress the aforementioned issue, we propose a novelPF method named Regional Mask Guided Network(RMGN). More specifically, a regional mask is pro-posed to explicitly fuse the features of target clothesand reference persons so that the persisted distrac-tion can be eliminated. A posture awareness lossand a multi-level feature extractor are further pro-posed to handle the complicated postures and syn-thesize high resolution images. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate that our proposed RMGN out-performs both state-of-the-art PB and PF methods.Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness ofmodules in RMGN.*
